websockd turns any program into a websocket server.

When a new request is received, inetd is configured to run websockd
instead of the server program. websockd handles the initial handshake
and connection upgrade, and then silently passes data back and forth
between the websocket client and your server program. Websocket framing
is removed from incoming data and added to outgoing data, so the server
program can simply read and write bytes from standard IO without needing
to worry about the underlying websocket protocol.

websockd takes the name of the server to run from argument zero. By
default, it will look for the server program to run in `/usr/sbin'.

EXAMPLES

The following line in /etc/inetd.conf will listed for a websocket
connection on port 8002 and connect it to the server program at
`/usr/sbin/life':

8002    stream  tcp     nowait  nobody  /usr/sbin/websockd      life
